# Idol Ecommerce

> This project is based from **[IDOL SHOPPING NETWORK](https://idolshoppingnetwork.com/)**. I have no intentions to make profit on this project or anything that is harmful to the developer and owner of the _IDOL SHOPPING NETWORK_ website, this is just to showcase my skills in building website using react and other front end technologies that I used to build this project.

> This project is fully responsive and I also implemented routing.
> I used a rest api called Fake Store API for the products list, details and categories.
