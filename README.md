# Idol Ecommerce

> This project is based from **[IDOL SHOPPING NETWORK](https://idolshoppingnetwork.com/)**. I have no intentions to make profit on this project or anything that is harmful to the developer and owner of the _IDOL SHOPPING NETWORK_ website, this is just to showcase my skills in building website using react and other front end technologies that I used to build this project.

> Just like _IDOL SHOPPING NETWORK_, you can add items and view the cart and you can also view specific category and product. There are still many features that I haven't implemented on this project like user login and registration, ability to checkout in the cart and many more. I used a free rest api for the products details and categories, check the link below for the api.
